## Summary
- add an experimental PySide6 settings scaffold alongside the existing wxPython app
- implement a `QtSettingsDialog` with accessibility contracts inspired by the sample repo:
  - label/control buddy wiring
  - explicit accessible names
  - initial focus on the settings tab control
  - spin/combo/edit/checkbox mapping to the existing `Settings` model
- add `--qt-settings-prototype` launch flag in `portkeydrop.main` to run the Qt dialog from main app context
- keep wxPython startup path as the default behavior
- add tests for Qt dialog contracts and settings round-trip behavior
- document experimental run instructions in README

## Testing
- `.venv/bin/ruff check`
- `.venv/bin/pytest -q`

## Notes
- migration is intentionally minimal and reversible for phase 1
- no existing wx business logic/settings model behavior was removed or refactored
